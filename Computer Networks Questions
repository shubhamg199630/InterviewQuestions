What is OSI Model?
Ans : OSI (Open System Interconnection model) 
      It is used how communication happen between two computer over network. For Example if one is mac and another is windows we need some standard protocol steps for this.
      OSI was introduced in 1984. It is 7 layer model.
      
      Application Layer : It is used by network application ( application that use internet for communication , example like gmail, skype etc).
      HTTPS / HTTPS ( web serfing.
      FTP : File Tranfer Protocol ( used for sending File from server to client)
      Email : SMTP
      Remote Device / System : Telnet , port is 23;
      DNS : Domain Name Service : it is used to convert hostname address to IP address.
      
      Presentation Layer : Presentation Layer has mutiple functions
                1) Data Translation : Converting data received from the application layer to Binary 0 and 1, Example is ASCII to Binary
                2) Data Compression : Data compression is the function of presentation layer in OSI reference model. Compression is
                                      often used to maximize the use of bandwidth across a network or to optimize disk space when
                                      saving data.
                                      There are two general types of compression algorithms:
                                      1. Lossless compression : Lossless compression compresses the data in such a way that when data is decompressed it is exactly the 
                                                                same as it was before compression i.e. there is no loss of data. A lossless compression is used to 
                                                                compress file data such as executable code, text files, and numeric data, because programs that process 
                                                                such file data cannot tolerate mistakes in the data.
                                      2. Lossy compression : Lossy compression is the one that does not promise that the data received is exactly the same as data send 
                                                             i.e. the data may be lost. This is because a lossy algorithm removes information that it cannot later restore.
                                                             Lossy algorithms are used to compress still images, video and audio. Lossy algorithms typically achieve much 
                                                             better compression ratios than the lossless algorithms.
                3) Encryption and Decryption (Secure Socket Layer Protocol ) : Here we will Encrypt / decryption of data to keep it safe.
                   There are three main components to what the TLS protocol accomplishes( future version of SSL) : Encryption, Authentication, and Integrity.
                        TLS : Transport Layer Security , but it is not transport layer protocol, but it is layer 6 prestation layer. Same for SSL also.
                                    Encryption: hides the data being transferred from third parties.
                                    Authentication: ensures that the parties exchanging information are who they claim to be.
                                    Integrity: verifies that the data has not been forged or tampered with.
                         Note : OSI model is a guideline , after layer 4 , any thing is possible.
